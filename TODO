* Make SCP
* Use blaze-builder
* Handle packets of different layers correctly when a session is active (rekeying!)
* Server
* J-PAKE
* RSA stuff
* Document (in)compatibility with RFCs
* UTF8
* Various TODOs everywhere
* Less dependencies on IO (especially in Monad Stacks)
* Cabalize
* Handle errors (MAC, invalid host key cert, etc)
* Replace usages of fromJust, head, tail with their safe variants (like in KeyExchange)
* I don't like the safe head versions with an error call either, check if that can be designed better
